## A Fresh Start

We're thrilled to announce the launch of our brand new website! Built from scratch using modern web technologies, the new cueism.com is faster, easier to navigate, and designed to give you the best shopping experience possible.

### What's New

- **Faster checkout** — powered by Stripe for seamless, secure payments
- **Real-time shipping quotes** — live Australia Post rates calculated at checkout
- **Monthly news roundups** — curated billiard news from around the world
- **Mobile-first design** — looks great on any device

### Same Commitment to Sustainability

While the tech has changed, our values haven't. We're still 3D printing every product to order using recycled and biodegradable materials, ensuring the smallest possible carbon footprint.

### What's Next

In the coming months, we'll be adding:
- Member accounts for repeat customers
- Product reviews and comments
- Expanded product range
- International shipping to more countries

Stay tuned, and thanks for supporting Australian-made billiard gear!
